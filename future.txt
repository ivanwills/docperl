Bugs
* AJAX history not always working particularly if you navigate to a real named anchor
* Not all links are properly handled via hashing eg API page

Features
* Highlight the currently viewed modules path (.parent and .open classes)
* Only show current module version
* Projects display - more than on local code section
* Convert to Config::General will help with the last point
* AJAX module list loading
