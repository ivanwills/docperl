*Installation*

DocPerl requires little in the way of installation. You need to place the
files where ever you want and then set up your web server to execute the
docperl.cgi script. For apache this may be just adding something like:

<Directory "/path/to/docperl">
    Options +ExecCGI
    AllowOverride Limit
    DirectoryIndex docperl.cgi
    AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
</Directory>

You should run ./checksetup.pl which tell you what required modules are
installed or not on your system. Also ./checksetup.pl can be used to create
pre-cached POD files to speed up usage with the command:

  $ ./checksetup.pl -c pod

or see

  $ ./checksetup.pl -h

for more details on ./checksetup.pl usage

DocPerl needs some Perl modules that may not be already installed these
include:
Template Toolkit
Readonly
Config::Std
version
Pod::POM

to install one of the following commands should work
  $ cpan Template Readonly
or
  $ perl -MCPAN -e 'install Template; install Readonly'
or for active Perl users
  $ ppm install Template
  $ ppm install Readonly

If you have any problems try going to the help forums at
https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=553595

*Windows*

Installation on windows has now improved a lot, the dependencies on command
line programs have been removed. The major problems you may now encounter are
setting setting the Perl scripts bang line to you Perl location (if you do not
download the windows zip file or your Perl is not installed into C:/Perl).
Work-arounds are to change the bang line from:

#!/usr/bin/perl

to

#!"C:/perl/bin/perl.exe"

or where ever your perl is installed. You can set Apache to use file
extensions instead (see your Apache documentation for details)


* If you are using Active Perl's ppm to get the Template Toolkit modules
you may encounter some difficulty as ppm install Template does not appear to
install the Template Toolkit, you will probably need to use CPAN.

* DocPerl does not appear to work with Active Perl 5.6 due to not being able
to install all dependent modules.

*Upgrading*

If you are upgrading from DocPerl version 0.3 or earlier there have been some
structural changes to DocPerl. Firstly the file docperl.conf has been moved
from the data directory up one level to the base directory (to allow you to
set where the data directory is stored). Also the templates have been renamed
to have the extension .tmpl added to their names so if you have customised
any templates you will need to add .tmpl to their names.
