Installation:

DocPerl requires little in the way of installation. You need to place the
files where ever you want and then set up your web server to execute the
docperl.cgi script. For apache this may be just adding something like:

<Directory "/path/to/docperl">
	Options +ExecCGI
    AllowOverride Limit
    DirectoryIndex docperl.cgi
    AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
</Directory>

You should run ./checksetup.pl which tell you what required modules are
installed or not on your system. Also ./checksetup.pl can be used to create
pre-cached POD files to speed up usage with the command:

./checksetup.pl -c pod

see

./checksetup.pl -h

for more detais on ./checksetup.pl usage

DocPerl needs some perl modules that may not be already installed these
include:
Template Toolkit
Readonly
Config::Std
version

to install one of the following commands should work
cpan Template Readonly
or
perl -MCPAN -e 'install Template; install Readonly'
or for active perl users
ppm install Template
ppm install Readonly

If you have any problems try going to the help forums at
https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=553595

Windows

Currently installation on Windows can be a bit tricky but is possible. You need
some command line tools that windows does not by default provide:
touch - used to set cached files times to that of the original file
rm    - used by checksetup .pl to clear the cache files

These files are available with cygwin (http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin)


* If you are using active perl's ppm to get the Template Toolkit modules
you may encounter some difficulity as ppm install Template does not appear to
install the Template Toolkit, you will probably need to use CPAN.
