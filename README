DocPerl

For installations and upgrading instructions please see the INSTALL file.

DocPerl provides access to the POD documentation provided by Perl files as
well as showing the code of the files and a summary of the API that a file
defines.

DocPerl allows easy browsing of the modules installed on the server that is is
run from. It can be setup to display your own project's Perl files by adding
the directories that those files are stored in, into the Path parameter of the
Local section of your docperl.conf file (located in the data directory).

For more details on the options that can look at the documentation in
DocPerl/Config.pod

If you would like DocPerl to use pre generated POD files instead of creating
them on the fly the first time they are needed you can use the following
command:

$ ./checksetup.pl -c pod

Note: this will generate a lot of error which can generally be ignored (they
are caused by bad or missing POD in the standard Perl module files)
