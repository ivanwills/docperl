DocPerl

Installation:

DocPerl requires little in the way of installation. You need to place the
files where ever you want and then set up your web server to execute the
docperl.cgi script. For apache this may be just adding something like:

<Directory "/path/to/docperl">
	Options +ExecCGI
    AllowOverride Limit
    DirectoryIndex docperl.cgi
    AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
</Directory>

DocPerl needs some perl modules that may not be already installed these
include:
Template Toolkit
Readonly

to install one of the following commands should work
cpan Template Readonly
or
perl -MCPAN -e 'install Template; install Readonly'
or for active perl users
(forgotten)
